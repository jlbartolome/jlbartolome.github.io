I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, and member of the [Computational theory in Condensed Matter Physics group](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/computational-many-body-theory/home). My research field is the quantum theory of solids, at the intersection between condensed matter physics, high performance computing, and materials science. A particular emphasis of my research is on the interaction between electrons and atomic vibrations in materials, as well as on the prediction of related emergent properties such as polaron formation and superconductivity.

I obtained my BSc in Physics (2014), MSc in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (2015), and PhD in Physics of Nanostructures and Advanced Materials (2020) at UPV/EHU. I was a postdoctoral Fellow at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin (2021-2023), and an IKUR postdoctoral researcher at the Donostia International Physics Center (2023). 


[comment]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
